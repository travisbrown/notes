The Cultural Logic of Computation
=================================

Golumbia working hard to turn Chomsky and Fodor and co. into
authoritarianism-loving capitalists:

> It may be surprising too to learn that Chomsky's principal contribution to
> computer science—perhaps even one of the chief goals for which he was
> receiving funding—is explicitly called a "hierarchy," that especially exact
> and abstract trope of ordered, striated power. Chomsky's political work has
> long been opposed to just such formations, strongly favoring distributed and
> rhizomatic syndicates to empires and kingdoms. But the hierarchy is critical
> for keeping logical (and so computational) languages on the same plane with
> natural languages, the ones Chomsky continues to have in mind. (52)

This paragraph ends:

> In his overt politics, Chomsky opposes the necessity of hierarchies in the
> strongest way, while his intellectual work is predicated and on the intuitive
> notion that language and cognition require hierarcies. For Chomsky there must
> be no connection between these two spheres, despite the obvious (but
> structural and unconscious) ways in which they seem to connect. This is
> consonant with a core tenet of dominant Western modernity, which is that the
> way the rational part of the mind construes the world must be all there is to
> understanding the world. (52)

In the next chapter Golumbia quotes a passage from _The Mind Doesn't Work That
Way_ in which Fodor describes a characterization of Turing as "Hamlet without
the Prince", and then changes the subject:

> This passage displays the familiar rhetorical elements present in much of
> Fodor's writing, including literary allusion that is striking in both its
> cultural valense and its specific invocation of royal hierarchy (in that
> _Hamlet_ is often discussed in terms of character without mentioning
> Hamlet's royal standing). (70)

The end of the section is even worse:

> Fodor's view is that in particular the term "belief has a functional
> essence... Ditto, _mutatis mutandis_, 'capitalism,' 'carburetor,' and the
> like" (Fodor 1998a, 8). It is the second example that is explicit, because
> Fodor's views have sometimes been understood to mean that _carburetor_ is an
> innate concept. _Carburetor_ is the perfect cultural example, in its
> specific evocation of the Fordist ordering of production and its suggestion
> that the modern vehicle itself and its processes of production are an
> essential part of human being. (92)

This already makes no sense to me, but Golumbia immediately doubles down on
the non sequitur:

> What Fodor adds in to the equation as he begins to dissent from
> functionalism, then, is _capitalism_, and it is hard to imagine a more
> apposite way of indicating the political heritage within which his line of
> thought turns out to be profoundly implicated. (72)

I don't see any way this could be supported by the passage in question, but
that's all the evidence we get.

Computational linguistics, diversity, etc.
------------------------------------------

Golumbia gestures a few times at distinguishing between _computational
linguistics_ in the "broad" sense (which he calls "almost indistinguishable
from Chomskyan generativism") and in the language processing sense, but then
seems to muddle them over and over.

For example, this is not at all in line with my experience:

> The scholars who pursue Chomskyanism and Chomsky himself with near-religious
> fervor are, almost without exception, straight white men who might be taken
> by nonlinguists to be "computer geeks." (46)

Either in terms of what I know about the authors I've read in this area, or in
my personal experience of the linguistics departments of UT Austin (which is
non-Chomskyan, computational in both senses, and full of people who more or
less fit this description) and UMD (which is deeply Chomskyan, computational
primarily in the broad sense, and full of people who don't).

The following may at least be true:

> Although there are many exceptions, it is still true that Chomskyan
> approaches have tended to attract white men (and also men from notably
> imperial cultures, such as those of Korea and Japan), and that women and
> minority linguists have tended to favor non-Chomskyan approaches. (41)

But the causes of the problem are a lot more complicated than "Chomsky is a
secret imperialist patriarch".

The silly
---------

I know this is nitpicking, but for the record:

> But its concept of system is rudimentary. It is less elaborate than the kind
> of logical structure computer scientists call an _algorithm_, or at any rate
> forms one of the most basic types of algorithm, an ordered list. (18)

On the next page he starts riding one of my personal hobbyhorses, and then
goes and refers to HTML as a scripting language:

> Languages are not codes; programming "languages" like Basic and FORTRAN and
> scripting "languages" like HTML and JavaScript do not serve the functions
> that human languages do. (19)

I'll probably eventually need a whole section for Golumbia's "Linguistic
Computationalism" chapter, but for now this can go here:

> ...(and even Chomsky's formalism, arguably the most hierarchical of current
> linguistic theories, seems irreconcilable with anything like OHCO). (107)
